Sauté for a couple of minutes.\r\nAdd the marinated mutton and cook on high heat until the mutton pieces are well-sealed and browned.\r\nSimmering:\r\n\r\nReduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer until the mutton is almost tender, stirring occasionally.\r\nIf the mixture becomes too dry, you can add a little water.\r\nFinal Cooking:\r\n\r\nOnce the mutton is almost tender, uncover the pot and cook on medium heat until the gravy thickens.\r\nAdjust salt and spice levels according to your taste.\r\nGarnish and Serve:\r\n\r\nGarnish with fresh coriander leaves.\r\nServe the mutton curry hot with rice, naan, or roti.\r\nFeel free to customize the recipe based on your preferences. Enjoy your mutton curry!";
